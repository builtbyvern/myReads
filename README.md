# MyReads - A Book Lending App

MyReads is a small React app that utilizes an API provided by Udacity to create a
personal libray of books sorted into these bookshelves:

* Currently Reading
* Want To Read
* Read

### Up and Running

Clone the repo to your desired directory. Launch your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run 

`npm install` and `npm start`.

### Usage

Books will appear in the root url `/`. Click the add button at the bottom and you will be redirected to `/search` and 
given the ability to search for new books to add to your library. Once you find a book you want, click the 
book's dropdown and choose which shelf you would like it in. Navigating back home, the book will still be present.
Even on refresh.
